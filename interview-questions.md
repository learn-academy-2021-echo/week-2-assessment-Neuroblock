# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer:  A parameter is a set of values in a function that call for an argument.

  Researched answer: Parameters are the functions' argument.  The function only gets to know the values, not the arguments' locations.  If a function changes an arguments' value, it does not change the parameters' original value.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The higher order function uses data types that are called within the function, and maps them out.

  Researched answer: "The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array"
  developer.mozilla.org.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Destructuring in my understanding involves taking apart code to create new functions.

  Researched answer: "Destructuring is an expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps and set them into new arrays, objects, and maps and set them into new, distinct variables.   allows us to extract multiple properties, or items, from any array at a time."  www.educative.io.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a data block that resolves an argument, problem. A method, and i am taking a guess, is an approach to solving problems. A function within a function.

  Researched answer: "Functions are reusable pieces of code that only execute when invoked and always return an output.  Functions have information (arguments) passed into the scope of the function through placeholders called parameters.  Functions are designed to be used many times in a program" "A method is an object with behavior.  It is a function that belongs to an object" github.com.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint and an object is a function within a function.

  Researched answer: "Classes are particular Javascript keywords that are used to create and access information within a class"  "An object is a data type that contain collections of key:value pairs. Objects are the cross sections of data (static information) and behavior (methods)." github.com



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I believe it has something to do with hooking or fetching.

  Researched answer: "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope. In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared." www.w3schools.com.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance:  A class created with a class inheritance inherits all methods from another class.

2. React: React is a library for creating user interfaces.  Everything in React is a component.

3. React state: State is an object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation.

4. React lifecycle methods: Each component in React has a lifecycle which can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.  The three phases are: Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.

5. DOM: 'Document Object Model' represents the entire UI of the application in a tree data structure.
